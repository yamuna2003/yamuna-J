I am interested in data science because I love play with data and also curious to learn concepts in the field of data.
The following simple python code is just calculate sum of n range number.
In [7]:
def nsum(num):
    total=0
    for i in range(num):
        total=total+i
    return total

total_sum = nsum(int(input("Enter N range value:")))
print("total sum is:",total_sum)
Enter N range value:7
total sum is: 21
